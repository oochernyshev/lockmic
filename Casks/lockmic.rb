# Homebrew Cask for LockMic (must live at repo-root Casks/ for `brew tap`).
#
# Install, update, or restore (Homebrew 6+ needs brew trust for third-party casks):
#   brew tap oochernyshev/lockmic https://github.com/oochernyshev/lockmic
#   brew trust --cask oochernyshev/lockmic/lockmic
#   brew update
#   brew reinstall --cask --yes lockmic || brew install --cask lockmic
#   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LockMic.app
#   open /Applications/LockMic.app
#
# Uninstall:
#   brew uninstall --cask lockmic
#
# Or from a local clone (no tap):
#   brew reinstall --cask --yes --force ./Casks/lockmic.rb || brew install --cask ./Casks/lockmic.rb
#   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LockMic.app
#
# xattr clears Gatekeeper quarantine until Developer ID + notarization.
